install webpack --> npm install -g webpack webpack-cli 

make a src directory in the top level of file tree. 
make a dist directiory in the top level of the file tree. 


inside src folder -- create an index.js ---> entry file for webpack and all the javascript code 


webpack --watch --mode=development will create the dist/main.js file ----> this is everything bundled. 

after running and creating the dist/main.js  --- add dist/main.js to the index.html ---- <script src="dist/main.js" /> 



inside the index.js entry file yo.u can import a class that contains the complete game logic. ---> think object oriented design

this is where you wait until the dom is loaded to start your game / maze 

import Maze from './MazeGame.js' 
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ()=> {
    const maze = new Maze(); //maze is a class that exists inside of MazeGameLogic.js 

    maze.startMaze(); //this is a method inside of your Maze class that starts running everythng. 
})
